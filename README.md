# TravelingSalesManSwarm

I am teaching myself C++ and I am a little weird so the way I choose to do that is by building Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms and trying to optimize them to the Traveling Salesman Problem. This algorithm includes several cool tricks that I could not do in Python which proves to me that C++ is awesome and I understand why it is loved.
